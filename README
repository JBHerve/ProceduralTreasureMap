# Procedural Treasure Map (Summer Procjam 2018)

A Treasure Map generator I made for the Summer Procjam.
It was made during one week, with approximately one hour of coding per day.

I know the code is not optimized nor write in the finest Python, but I wanted to post the code as it was after one week.
I may improve code or add features in the future.

## Install dependencies

You will need Python 3 installed
Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will also need a graphic interface in order to use PIL.image.show()

## Run it

Run `python MapGenerator.py`
By default, it will generate a map and display it.
If you want to save it, you can uncomment line 296 in *MapGenerator.py*

As I don't own any right on the parchment texture, I didn't add it to the repository. 
You can use your own texture by switching comments line 250

At the top of the *MapGenerator.py*, you will find all the variables used for generation, feel free to tweak them.
